# OneWordGame
A game using one word with team. This is my first project working with a team on GitHub.

## Git Gud
Today we will be developing our very own games! The scope of the game can be anything you want, but some examples include tic-tac-toe, hangman, or trivia. I was grouped with another students to create our game and will have two days to work on it. Plan out the app with partners to ensure we have time to finish. 

## Getting Started
Start by having one person create a GitHub repo and adding the other as a Collaborator. (We can find this under the settings tab of our repo). WE WILL NOT BE FORKING AND CLONING. Our goal is to work collaboratively on a single repo to get our finished game from both collaborators.

### Requirements 
- Each person will be required to make at least 10 COMMITS. (You will be merging more than you would normally on this project.) 
- If we don't run into merge conflicts naturally throughout the collaborative process, we are required to force merge conflicts (3 minimum conflicts  **verified by a mentor**) in order to get the practice you need to solve those conflicts through GitHub and terminal. 
- Take advantage of this experience as it will be a tremendous help come time for group projects!

### Now, go GIT GUD!
